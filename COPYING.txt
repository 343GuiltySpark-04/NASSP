             BE AWARE: YOU CANNOT LEGALLY CREATE A COMBINED
               BINARY DISTRIBUTION OF NASSP AND ORBITER!

NASSP is a DLL plugin for a non-Free software program, Orbiter.

The GPL v2 does not permit the DISTRIBUTION of a combined Free DLL and 
non-Free program.

The USAGE of such a combination is perfectly legal, as the GPL v2 is a 
DISTRIBUTION license and not a USAGE license. The GPL specifically 
states it only covers COPYING, MODIFICATION, and DISTRIBUTION of 
software and not RUNNING of software.

A violation occurs only when someone combines the GPL library with the 
closed source component and then distributes the result.

Only the copyright holders of the project have a course of action if 
someone does combine the works and distribute them. 

We do include GPLed code from other projects. The copyright holders of 
those projects can take action against anyone who distributes a combined 
NASSP/Orbiter binary, but they cannot take action against us, or anyone 
who merely uses NASSP with Orbiter. Only the act of distribution of a 
combined NASSP/Orbiter binary package can create a violation.

Remember, the GPL is a license that we, the copyright holders, grant. We 
own the rights. We are the only people who can bother anyone else for 
violating the terms of the license.

Please refer to the GPL v2, available in the repository root directory 
as NASSP-LICENSE.txt, for more information.
