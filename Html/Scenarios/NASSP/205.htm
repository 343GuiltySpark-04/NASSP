capability. This consisted of a test of the closed loop spacecraft/launch
vehicle control system by performing manual pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers. The
control system responded properly. After completion of the test, the crew
switched attitude control back to the automatic launch vehicle system which resumed
the normal attitude timeline. By the time the CSM/S-IVB separated at

under the orbital conditions experienced. The first venting occurred at
000:10:17, and the final one ended at 005:11:15. The seven ventings totaled
3,274.1 seconds. Second, a liquid oxygen dump was initiated at 001:34:28 and

again at 004:30:16, lasting 2,868.00 and 1,199.99 seconds, respectively.
Finally, a stage control sphere helium dump occurred at 003:17:33, but was
terminated by ground command after 2,967 seconds to save the remaining helium
for control of the LH<sub><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:111%'>2</span></sub>
