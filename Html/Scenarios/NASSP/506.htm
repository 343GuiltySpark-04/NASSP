of the lunar landing site and by the acceptable range of sun elevation angles.
The range of these angles was from 5° to 14° and in a direction from east to
west. Under these conditions, visible shadows of craters would aid the crew in recognizing topographical
features. When the sun angle approached the descent angle, the mean value of
which was 16°, visual resolution would be degraded by a “washout” phenomenon
where backward reflectance was high enough to eliminate contrast. Sun angles above the flight path were
not as desirable because shadows would not be readily visible unless the sun
was significantly outside the descent plane. In addition, higher sun angles
(greater than 18°) could be eliminated from consideration by planning the landing one day earlier where
the lighting is at least 5°. Because lunar sunlight incidence changed about
0.5° per hour, the sun elevation angle restriction established a 16-hour
period, which occurred every 29.5 days, when landing at a given site could be attempted. The number of Earth-launch
opportunities for a given lunar month was equal to the number of candidate landing sites.</p>

allowable variation in launch pad azimuth and by the location of the Moon at
spacecraft arrival. The spacecraft had to be launched into an orbital plane
that contained the position of the Moon and its antipode at spacecraft arrival. A 34° launch pad azimuth variation
afforded a launch period of 4 hours 30 minutes. This period was called the
“daily launch window,” the time when the direction of launch was within the
required range to intercept the Moon.</p>

the crew donned biological isolation garments and exited the CM into a rubber
boat, where they were scrubbed down with an iodine solution to protect against
“lunar germs.” They were then retrieved by helicopter and taken to the primary
recovery ship, where they arrived 63 minutes after splashdown. The CM was recovered
125 minutes later. The estimated CM weight at splashdown was 10,873.0 pounds,
and the estimated distance traveled for the mission was 828,743 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apollo 11 mission, including a piloted lunar landing
and surface exploration, was conducted with skill, precision, and relative
ease. The excellent performance of the spacecraft in the preceding four
missions and the thorough planning in all aspects of the program permitted the
safe and efficient execution of this mission. The following conclusions were
made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
effectiveness of pre-mission training was reflected in the skill and precision
with which the crew executed the lunar landing. Manual control while
maneuvering to the desired landing point was satisfactorily exercised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

planned techniques involved in the guidance, navigation, and control of the
descent trajectory were good. Performance of the landing radar met all
expectations in providing the information required for descent.</p>

extravehicular mobility units were adequately designed to enable the crew to
conduct the planned activities. Adaptation to 1/6 g was relatively quick, and
mobility on the lunar surface was easy.</p>
