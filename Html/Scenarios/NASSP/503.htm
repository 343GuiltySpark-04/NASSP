margin-left:-.25pt'>Apollo 8 was a Type “C prime” mission, a CSM piloted flight
demonstration in lunar orbit instead of Earth orbit like Apollo 7. It was the
first mission to take humans to the vicinity of the Moon, a bold step forward
in the development of a lunar landing capability.</p>

Earth orbital mission to be launched in May 1968 with boilerplate payload BP-30
instead of an operational spacecraft. The success of Apollo 6 (AS-502),
however, led to the decision on 27 April that AS-503 would be a piloted mission
with a CSM and LM instead of BP-30.</p>

be returned to the Mississippi Test Facility for “man-rating.” Additional tests
for a piloted flight continued at KSC. The Mississippi tests were successfully
completed on 30 May 1968 and the stage returned to the Kennedy Space Center on
27 June.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>After two months of testing, which started 11 June 1968, it
was determined that the LM would not be ready for the projected early December
launch. Therefore, the decision was made on 19 August that a 19,900-pound LM
test article would be installed in the spacecraft/launch vehicle adapter for
mass loading purposes, replacing the LM. It was also on this date that the crew
was instructed to train for a mission to the Moon, officially designated
“Apollo 8.”</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>The possibility of conducting a lunar mission was first discussed
with the crew on 10 August, and the results of Apollo 7, to be launched in
October, would determine whether the mission would be lunar orbital,
circumlunar, or Earth orbital. All training immediately focused on the lunar
orbital mission, the most difficult of the three, and ground support
preparations were accelerated. The first simulation exercise was conducted on 9
September, and the space vehicle was transferred to the launch site on 9
October.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>Following the successful completion of Apollo 7 on 22
October, the official decision to conduct a lunar orbit mission was made 12
November, just five weeks before the scheduled launch. The decision was made
after a thorough evaluation of spacecraft performance during Apollo 7’s ten
days in Earth orbit and an assessment of the risks involved in a lunar orbit
mission. These risks included the total dependency upon the service propulsion
engine for propelling the spacecraft from lunar orbit, and a lunar orbit return
time of three days, compared to an Earth orbit return of just 30 minutes to
three hours. Also considered was the value of the flight in furthering the goal
of landing a human on the Moon before the end of 1969. The principal gains from
a lunar mission would include experience in deep space navigation,
communications, and tracking; greater knowledge of spacecraft thermal response
to deep space; and crew operational experience—all directly applicable to lunar
landing missions.</p>

Ford Island, Hawaii. The Landing Safing Team began the evaluation and
deactivation procedures at 21:00 GMT, and completed them on 1 January 1969. The
CM was then flown to Long Beach, California, and trucked to the North American
Rockwell Space Division facility at Downey, California for postflight analysis.
It arrived on 2 January 1969 at 21:00 GMT.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>With only minor problems, all Apollo 8 spacecraft systems
operated as intended, and all primary mission objectives were successfully
accomplished. Crew performance was admirable throughout the mission.
Approximately 90 percent of the photographic objectives were accomplished and
60 percent of the additional lunar photographs requested as “targets of
opportunity” were also taken, despite fogging of three of the spacecraft
windows due to exposure of the window sealant to the space environment and
early curtailment of crew activities due to fatigue. Many smaller lunar
features, previously undiscovered, were photographed. These features were
located principally on the far side of the Moon in areas which had been
photographed only at much greater distances by automated spacecraft. In
addition, the heat shield system was not adversely affected by exposure to
cislunar space or to the lunar environment and performed as expected. The
following conclusions were made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

satisfactory means of maintaining critical spacecraft temperatures near the

navigation techniques developed for translunar and lunar orbit flight were
proved to be more than adequate to maintain required lunar orbit insertion and

sleep periods adversely affected the normal circadian cycle of each crew member
and provided a poor environment for undisturbed rest. Mission activity
scheduling for the lunar orbit coast phase also did not provide adequate time
for required crew rest periods.</p>

observations of the lunar surface showed the “washout” effect (surface detail
being obscured by backscatter) to be much less severe than anticipated. In
addition, smaller surface details were visible in shadow areas at low sun
angles, indicating that lighting for lunar landing should be photometrically
acceptable.</p>

accommodate the change in Apollo 8 from an Earth orbital to a lunar mission,
pre-mission planning, crew training, and ground support reconfigurations were
completed in a time period significantly shorter than usual. The required
response was particularly demanding on the crew and, although not desirable on
a long-term basis, exhibited a capability which had never before been
demonstrated.</p>
