in a better rescue position for rendezvous activities. During these two burns,
tests were made to measure the oscillatory response of a docked spacecraft to
provide data to improve the autopilot response for this configuration. The

node east and put the spacecraft in a better position later for lighting,
braking, and docking.</p>
