	placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
	of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
	program or work, and a
	&ldquo;work based on the Program
	&rdquo; means either
	the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
	work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
	modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
	is included without limitation in the term
	&ldquo;modification
	&rdquo;.) Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.
      </p><p>	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
	this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
	restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
	the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
	publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
	keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
	warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
	along with the Program.
      </p><p>	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
	your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	or work under the terms of
	<a href="gpl1.html#gpl-2-1">Section 1

	      this License.
	    </p></li><li><p><a name="N106D5"></a>	      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
	      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
	      ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
	      copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
	      that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
	      under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
	      License.

      </p><p>	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
	of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
	independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
	do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when
	you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
	Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
	permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and
	every part regardless of who wrote it.
      </p><p>	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
	to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control
	the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      </p><p>	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
	(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
	does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
	<a href="gpl1.html#gpl-2-2">Section 2
	</a> in object code or executable form under the terms of
	<a href="gpl1.html#gpl-2-1">Sections 1
	</a> and
	<a href="gpl1.html#gpl-2-2">2
	</a> above provided that you also do one of the following:
	<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="N106FA"></a>	Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
	      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	      customarily used for software interchange; or,
	    </p></li><li><p><a name="N106FD"></a>	      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
	      third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
	      distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code,
	      to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
	      used for software interchange; or,
	    </p></li><li><p><a name="N10700"></a>	      Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
	      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
	      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form
	      with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
	    </p></li></ol></div>
      </p><p>	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
	to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules
	it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
	compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
	code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
	binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
	on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
      </p><p>	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a
	designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
	counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to
	copy the source along with the object code.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
	under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
	Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
	licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
	else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
	These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
	or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
	of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
	modifying the Program or works based on it.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
	automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify
	the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
	on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
	compliance by third parties to this License.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
	reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
	agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
	from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
	your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
	you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
	royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or
	indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
	to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
      </p><p>	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
	the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
	in other circumstances.
      </p><p>	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property
	right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
	protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
	license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
	distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
	to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
	system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
      </p><p>	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the
	rest of this License.

      </span></h3></div></div><p>	If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents
	or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
	distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
	incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

	from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
	in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p><p>	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of
	this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms
	and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
	Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
	version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
	by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
	for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
