      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
      to your programs, too.
    </p><p>      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
      programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </p><p>      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
      copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </p><p>      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
      must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </p><p>      We protect your rights with two steps:
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="N10698"></a>	    copyright the software, and
	  </p></li><li><p><a name="N1069B"></a>	    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
	    distribute and/or modify the software.
	  </p></li></ol></div>
    </p><p>      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
      reputations.
    </p><p>      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    </p><p>      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow.
    </p></div></div>
