6.4:
----

Revised LEVA code, with 'flag planting' sound support.
Fixed up the LEM to work around missing sound if we switch to the lunar astronaut immediately after creating them.
Adjusted astronaut mesh position to make the walk closer to the moon's surface.
Turned more sounds into mission-specific sounds for NEP.

6.3:
----

Fixed bug preventing time acceleration for a few hours after course correction burn.
Renamed sound directory again from NCPP to ProjectApollo.
Wired in new Apollo-13 sounds.
Reduced volume of SIVB APS sounds and made them internal-only.
Moved time of course correction burn into header file to make it easy to change.
Realistic entry aerodynamics are added, documentation will follow soon.
Splashdown stage is no longer "underwater".

6.2:
----

Save light state to scenario file to support real operation as documented.
Hopefully the LV engine lights now work correctly as documented.
Turn off liftoff light as per documentation.
Added flags to sounds (in this case, specifying to only play at 1x time acceleration or less)
Changed CSM/LEM setup interface to pass a structure full of data rather than lots of parameters.
Added AUTOSLOW option for unmanned flights to stop time acceleration at important events.
Added lunar ascent sound to ascent autopilot, and made it a mission-specific sound for NEP. Renamed it lunar-ascent.wav for consistency.
In ascent autopilot, make sure that apogee is greater than perigee and both are at least 18km.
Added more automation for unmanned flights. You can now fly an Apollo 4 or 6 flight under automatic control.
Moved program 63 to lemautoland.cpp.
Changed sound to use NCPP directory rather than NASSP.
Rationalised soundlib sound loading functions so we now know exactly what each one does :).
Rewrote sound library interface to eliminate pointers in high-level code: less pointers means less places we can CTD.
Fixed click on HUD-mode toggle switches.
Fixed some missing mission sounds.
Disable ATC playback throughout the launch stage, so we can do our own playback instead.

6.1:
----

Added code for automated separation of CSM from SIVB in unmanned flights.
Improved positioning of SLA panels in CSM/SIVB separation: still not perfect yet.
New vessel configs for SIVB with different payloads: this may invalidate old saved scenarios docked to the SIVB!
Added SIVBPayload variable specifying what payload we're carrying (LEM or empty only for now).
Added Crewed variable so we know if the launch is unmanned, and removed the crew from the VC if it is unmanned.
Updated TCP values in scenarios to approximate values for the moment.
Added help file to config.
Hacky fix for the LEM being inside the SIVB when seperated.
LEM was updated to VESSEL2 but is now no longer a real VESSEL2 as I can't get it to work!
If cabin fans are enabled, turn the sound on after loading the scenario data.
Disable default launch sounds for LEM.
Added LEM ascent autopilot code.
Now expects all sound files to be in the NASSP directory, and doesn't use any from the Vessel sound directory.
Added basic multi-language support to soundlib.
Added AudioLanguage string to CSM and LEM and pass it to soundlib.
Use the mission time for LEM AGC timestep, not simulator time!
Moved various nouns from the CSM computer to the generic apollo guidance computer.
Added 'extended' parameter as an option to sound-loading calls, and set some to be audible internal-only.
Split out more of the Saturn 1b code into seperate files.
Split up LEM code into seperate files.
Initialised more soundlib variables to zero, for safety.
Try to prevent time acceleration during the first few seconds of launch, as the autopilot can't handle it.
Added new file for Saturn hardware systems emulation and started moving some of the 'decision' code from the main files into there.
AGC now calls DSKY through reference rather than pointer to reduce chances of calling through duff pointer.
DSKY now calls AGC through reference rather than pointer to reduce chances of calling through duff pointer.
Properly fixed loading of scenarios saved during 'recovery': added setting of touchdown points.

6.0:
----

Saturn 5/1b are now VESSEL2 class.
Fixed Saturn 1b SIVB autopilot.
Fixed virtual cockpit.
Hopefully full support for virtual cockpit for Saturn V.
Prevent view rotation in normal cockpit views.
Added display of 'erasable memory' in AGC.
Split out autopilot code into seperate files for easier maintenance.
Tried to fix loading of scenarios saved during 'recovery'.
Added general jostling of virtual cockpit view based on acceleration.
